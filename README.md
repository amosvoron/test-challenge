### Who we are

Irysan philosophy is “It all starts with people”. And when it comes to people, there is no “normal”. We believe that no person is the same as anyone else. Just like other consultancies, we use patterns of best practice across full software development lifecycle in a collaborative fashion. Unlike others, we take relationships with our people and clients to the next level. Our definition of success is not a project “finished on time and on budget”. It is effectively supporting you in reaching people and client goals.
